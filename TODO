- Create http client for making only get requests
  - 99.99% sure that ESV API calls are all get requests
- Write tests for http client
- Create esv api client that uses http client to make each of the calls available from the api
  - Will need to create models
  - Needs to have helper to set users token
  - simple methods for each possible request
- Write tests for esv api client
- Create esv api rules system so that before each request it can be verified whether or not the requester has hit a usage rule limit
- Add the rules system to the created esv api client
- Write tests for rules
- Add caching system that follows usage rules but allows the end user the ability to not have to make so many requests. Making this wrapper more useful.

- Document all the classes based on the documentation in api, for example, the optional parameters on all the parameter models
- I need somewhere to store things like the amount of chapters, verses in a book, other rule things
